        <h2>Site Description<h2>
            <p>This site is going to help us to determine the weather wherever you may be seeking.  Here or far we will help you to plan your trip or your wardrobe.</p>
        <h3>Site Name<h3>
            <p>This site is going to be called "This Weather Blows".  Sort of a fun play on words.  Something that not only describes a certain kind of weather but can also relate to many people who live in places where the weather is not too desirable.</p>
